What is laravel?
		Laravel is a PHP web framework that uses the MVC architecture.

MVC - Model View Controller

	Models:		Deals with database
	View:		Deals with the HTML
	Controller:	The middle-man


Serve site:
	command: php artisan serve


Routes
	Routes are located inside \app\http\routes.php

		Routes Examples: -> 1st Parameter is the route, 2nd param is the behavior function	
			Route::get('/', function(){
				return view('NameOfTheView');
			})

		Passing variables: Variables received in the url need to be passed to the function
			Route::get('/posts/{id}/{name}', function($id, $name){
				return "The id value is: ". $id . " and my name is ". $name;
			})

		Nick-naming a route:
		 	Route::get('/admin/posts/example', array('as' => 'admin.home', function(){

		 		$url = route('admin.home'); //passing hole url with route helper function
		 		return "this url is ". $url;

		 	}));

		 Routing to a controller method: 
		 	// id is going to be passed to method function
		 	Route::get('/post/{id}', 'ControllerName@method')

		 Creating named routes:
		 	Route:resource('posts', 'ControllerName');
		 	/*
		 	 |	This will create on "php artisan route:list" the CRUD routes for the different HTTP methods (DELETE, UPDATE, GET, etc)
		 	 |		
		 	 |		--------------------------------------------
		 	 |		METHOD 			URI				Name 		
		 	 |		--------------------------------------------
		 	 |		GET|HEAD		posts			posts.index
		 	 |		POST 			posts 			posts.store
		 	 |		GET|HEAD 		posts/create 	posts.create
		 	 |		DELETE 			posts/{posts}	posts.destroy
		 	 |		PUT|PATCH 		posts/{posts} 	posts.update
		 	 |		GET|HEAD 		posts/{posts} 	posts.show
		 	 |		GET|HEAD 		posts/{posts} 	posts.edit
		 	 |
		 	 */
		 	
	Commands:  
		php artisan route:list 	//Shows the list of routes in the project


Controllers
	Controllers are located in \app\Http\Controllers
	Always use CamelCase convention

	Commads: 
		//Creates a controller
		php artisan make:controller ControllerName

		//Creates controller as resource with CRUD functions
		php artisan make:controller --resource ControllerName	


Views
	Views are located in \resources\views\ files need to extention ".blade.php"

	Passing data to views:

		There are multiple ways of passing data to a view. Variable need to be used in the view as {{$variable}}

		Examples:

			return view('contact')->with('variable',$variable);

			For passing multiple parameters
				public function show_my_view($id, $name, $lastName){

					return view('contact', compact('id', 'name', 'lastName'))
				}

			    return view('contact', [
		            'firstName' => 'Carlos',
		            'lastName' => 'Garcia',
		            'age' => '30'
		        ]);

Using Blade
	 /* Popular convention: To create a Master Page named \resources\views\layouts\app.blade.php */

	 @extends('layout.app') -> Includes the layout in the view
	 
	 @yield('view_name') -> Is a section to be replaced with another content inside a view that extended the layout

	 @section('section_name') the name of the section where your code is going to be placed. It has to end with
	 @stop or @endsection

	 	Usage: 
	 			1. Layout name "app.blade.php" has a @yield named 'content'. 
	 			2. View has to @extends('app') to include the layout.
	 			3. The content inside the @section('content') will be placed inside the @yield of the layout
